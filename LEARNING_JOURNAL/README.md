 `LEARNING_LOG` is a folder to document the progress of my learning journey. I will use this folder to keep track of my learning activities, coding practices, and important notes from tutorials. 

It will help me maintain a consistent record of my progress and serve as a reference.

Within this folder, I plan to create text files for each day or week, detailing the coding exercises I've completed, the concepts I've learned, and any issues I've encountered.

This method will help create a detailed record of my learning journey over time.
